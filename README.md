### Welcome to a Completely Unstressed Presentation Group
*By Peter Vuong, Dara Estrada and Jason Lombino

## **Overview**
Microsoft is taking actionable steps into exploring a new movie studio branch of their business.
The objective of this project is to provide data for the company to use in deciding whether to continue implementing an idea through the exploration of historical movie data.


## **Business Understanding**
The primary questions we focused on were the following three:
	Who are the major competitors in the movie business?
	Which are the highest-grossing movie genres?
	What time of the year is best to release a movie?

    
## **Data Understanding**
We selected three sources to obtain data from. They are IMDB, The Numbers, and Box Office Mojo. These were selected due to the earning information and ease of mergability due to time constraints. 

The understanding for the project was that Microsoft needed data to be analyzied to find world wide gross metrics for competitior studios who have similar IP's.


Description of data
The datasets that were provided contained outliers that skewed data. This lead the group to prioritizing a median measure of central tendency instead of a mean.
