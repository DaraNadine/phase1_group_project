## **Overview**
Microsoft is launching an expansion into the movie studio industry.
The objective of this project is to provide the client with an analysis of historic data to identify top competition and mitgate launch risks. Our team narrowed their focus to evaluate potential competitors with simiar IP's, genres with the highest earnings and what time of the year is advantageous for a release.

We found that obtaining the median gross box office earnings, discovering the highest grossing genres, alongside the highest grossing season of the year all worked well to address the client goals.



## **Business Understanding**
For this project we focused on the following three questions:
	Who are Microsoft's major competitors if they launched a movie studio?
	Which are the highest-grossing movie genres?
	What time of the year is best to release a movie?
The reason for these specific 

    
## **Data Understanding**

**Sources**

We selected three sources to obtain data from: IMDB, The Numbers, and Box Office Mojo. These were chosen due to how well the information corresponded to our questions, along with their ease to effeciently combine in our limited time frame.

**Description**

The datasets that were provided contained outliers that skewed data. This lead the group to prioritizing a median measure of central tendency instead of a mean.

## **Conclusion**
What would we recommend the client do as a result of this work?

Return on investment is perhaps a more important figure to microsoft than profit values alone. We would need more complete budget data to be able to confidently draw any conclusions using this metric. Also, there is the need to look at an international market. With additonal data and time we would like to explore the impact international directors have on the bottom line. It may be worth Microsoft's time to consider looking into directors, including foriegn to perhaps reach a broader audience to boost earnings.
